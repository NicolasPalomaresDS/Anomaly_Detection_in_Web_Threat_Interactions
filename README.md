# Cybersecurity: Anomaly Detection in Suspicious Web Threat Interactions Using Machine Learning

### [Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection (Streamlit app)](https://isolationforest-anomalies.streamlit.app/)

The present project is aimed at detecting suspicious activities and potential attack attempts in web traffic interactions. It follows a systematic approach:

> **Baseline Model**: A simple statistical detector using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method establishes the minimum performance threshold. This baseline identifies extreme outliers based on traffic volume (bytes transferred).

> **Advanced Model**: An Isolation Forest algorithm captures multidimensional patterns that the baseline cannot detect, considering multiple features simultaneously (traffic volume, connection duration, time of day, geographic origin).

> **Comparative Analysis**: Both models are evaluated and compared using clustering quality metrics (Silhouette Score) to assess separation between normal and critical threats.

The data was generated by monitoring traffic to a production web server, using various detection rules to identify anomalous patterns.

### Directory Structure
* `app.py`: Streamlit application with the trained model.
* `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code.
* `requirements.txt`: Required libraries for notebook execution.
* `dataset/`: Dataset downloaded from notebook in CSV.
* `pipeline/`: Directory with the exported pipeline (scaler and Isolation Forest model).
* `scripts/`: Custom Python scripts.
    - `scripts/kaggle_setup.py`: For data download and Kaggle configuration.
    - `scripts/df_summary.py`: For a complete dataset summary generation.
    - `scripts/baseline_model.py`: Script with baseline model class.

### Requirements
You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas>=2.0.0 \
            numpy>=1.24.0 \
            scikit-learn>=1.3.0 \
            matplotlib>=3.7.0 \
            seaborn>=0.12.0 \
            matplotlib-venn>=0.11.0 \
            jupyter>=1.0.0 \
            ipython>=8.12.0 \
            joblib>=1.3.0 \
            streamlit==1.52.2 \
```

Alternatively, you can run the `requirements.txt` included in the project using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is also recommended to create a virtual enviroment for dependencies management:

```bash
# Crete virtual enviroment
python -m venv venv

# Activate
source venv/bin/activate     # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```

Once the virtual enviroment is configured, continue with the packages installation.
